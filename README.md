Solarized powerline style theme for zsh

Forked from [abner's solarized-powerline theme](https://github.com/houjunchen/solarized-powerline.git).

### Prerequisites

Install your favorite version of
[Powerline-patched fonts](https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline-fonts)

```
git clone https://github.com/houjunchen/solarized_powerline.git
ln -s solarized_powerline.zsh-theme ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/solarized_powerline.zsh-theme
