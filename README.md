Solarized powerline style theme for zsh

Forked from [abner's solarized-powerline theme](https://github.com/houjunchen/solarized-powerline.git).

### Prerequisites

Install your favorite version of
[Powerline-patched fonts](https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline-fonts)

### Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/victorfu/solarized-powerline.git
ln -s solarized_powerline.zsh-theme ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/solarized_powerline.zsh-theme

Note: To avoid `too many levels of symbolic links`, you may need to use absolute target in `ln -s`.

Modify ~/.zshrc setting

```
